Write about MERN-Stack?

A stack is the combination of technologies used to create a web application. Application will be made using multiple technologies (frameworks, libraries, db etc).

The MERN stack is a JavaScript stack that's is designed to make the development process smoother. It includes four components which is mentioned below . These components provide an end-to-end framework for developer to work in.

1. MongoDB: A Cross-platform document db

MongoDB is a coss-platform document oriented db program. Classified as a NoSQL(non-relation) program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. It is developed by MongoDB Inc.

2. Express: A back-end web application framework.

Express is a Fast, unopinionated, minimalist, web framework for Node.js that provide a robust set of features for web ,plugins and mobile applications. Instead of writing full web server code by hand on Node.js directly, developers uses express to simplify the task of writing server code. Therre's no need to repeat the same code over and over, as you would with the Node.js HTTP module.

3. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

4. Node.js: A cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment

Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications, and can execute JavaScript code of a browser. Node.js works without an enclosing HTML page, instead using its own module system based on CommonJS, to put together multiple JS file.
